Decided to create a video game, brainstormed ideas including android mobile application, VR
game and networked first-person shooter. Chose round-based zombie survival with 4-player co-op.

16/1/2020 
Started work on GDD, designed core gameplay loop and rough UI layout. Planned list of game 
objects such as guns and enemies.

19/1/2020 - Work (16:00 - 00:30)
Created unity project, and coded basic first person controller, with
mouse and keyboard controls, that could move, look and jump. 

20/1/2020 - Work (16:00 - 00:30)
Began development of networking, had to begin project again in new version of unity as
the version I was using did not have support for Photon PUN, my plugin of choice. Established connection 
from game to Photon servers.

22/1/2020
Created 'battle button' style matchmaking with one-click connect functionality. Learnt the basics of how to
use the photon plugin so I can develop my own matchmaking system as one-click is not great for the game I 
want to make. 

24/1/2020
Implemented 'server browser' style matchmaking with room creation and host migration. Player types in their 
chosen username before connecting to the photon master servers and seeing an available list of rooms which 
can be joined and the option to create a room of their own. Player that creates the room has a start button
available to them which can be clicked whenever all players are ready. 

25/1/2020 - Work (8:30 - 17:00)
Fixed issue with matchmaking UI that was causing all elements 
to spawn on top of each other. Fixed issues with spawning players into rooms.

Added recoil settings and fixed issues with the input system pertaining to left clicks not being 
detected. 

15/2/2020 - Work (8:30 - 17:00)
Created Gun Controller script, which encompasses everything every weapon will have/do. Levels,
damage, range etc. Also has the ability to aim down sights, reload and fire. 
Super reusable!!
Struggled with input system, game wouldn't detect left clicks. Problem with logic and button names, fixed.

22/2/2020 - Work (16:00 - 00:30)
Realised that I will need to make the iron sights a separate model from the guns, so that they
can be disabled to make room for scopes. Remade AK-47 and Desert Eagle model. Added scope attachment with
dual rendering for zoom effect. Added ability ability to switch between primary and secondary weapons.

Began development of in game UI. Created shop menu and added Tab button to bring it up/remove it.
Created Item listing for Deagle with a price, which you can purchase if you have enough money, adding it to the
inventory. Also created inventory UI, with 3 sections for primary, secondary and the rest of the items 
player has available. Fixed issues with server browser and player listing UI to do with the vertical layout group. 
Cleaned up room and lobby UI and code. Added network instantiation of player avatars which can be controlled by 
two different players, and their positions are synced across the network.

5/3/2020
Working on FMP proposal. 

6/3/2020
Moved weapon input and control to the networked player object so the weapons position and animations
can later be synced across the network. Designed new weapon equipping system with weapon manager parent object 
that holds a list of all weapons and a function to return one at a passed in index. This is then managed by the 
networked player object which gets the one it needs and all of the relevant info.

7/3/2020 - Work (12:00 - 21:00)

8/3/2020
Continued working on and debugging weapon management system. Created InventoryUI script to manage game
assets displaying UI elements. Tab brings up shop menu which has a list of weapon categories. Clicking on a category 
changes the stock panel to display all guns available for purchase with their price and a button to confirm the 
transaction if you are a high enough level and have enough money.

9/3/2020 - Work(16:00 - 00:30)

10/3/2020
Created UI artwork and downloaded fonts and redesigned lobby and menu UIs as well as the inventory UI and in game UI
such as crosshairs and health bar.  

11/3/2020 - Work (9:00 - 17:00)
Designed networking components of basic zombie type as well as the manager object. Used navmesh component
to give zombie ability to navigate to a certain spot while avoiding obstacles. Also created algorithm
which calculates which player is closest to the zombie and chooses that one to chase. 

12/3/2020 
Synced zombies positions across the network, added zombie model to zombie model prefab. 

13/3/2020
Added spawner functionality to the zombie manager which holds a list of the transforms of active spawn points,
and spawns zombies there until the round is over. Manages round number and increases difficulty over time.
Created airport lobby section of the map with downloaded assets (feeling like a remodel will be necessary to
increase the quality of the visual style). 

14/3/2020 - Work (12:00 - 21:00)
Created floor and wall tile assets. 
Remade lobby section of the map using tiles, glass panel material and stair object downloaded from Kenney
Game Assets.

16/3/2020 Work - (10:00 - 17:00) 
Created particle effect animations for muzzle flashes on weapons. Encountered issue with the number of
particles being emitted. After going through the process of trial and error I discovered that I had 
misunderstood the workings of the burst system and a lot of my particles were moving so fast they could 
not be seen. Also encountered an issue when trying to add a light effect, as referencing it in a script,
and enabling it then disabling when the particle effect is finished did not seem to work as the animation
was so short the light does not have time to render. I solved this by using the built-in lighting setting 
on the particle effect, which automatically lights up a certain percentage of the particles.  

17/3/2020
Created gun models in magica voxel and optimised them for unity in Blender: MP5, AUG, P99.
Made progress on UI code, buying guns adds them to inventory. Did this by creating a custom struct which 
holds the 2 objects that contain all of the gun information: gun controller and gun components. 
Then created 2 lists, one to contain all of the guns, and then when to contain the guns that have
been purchased. Added functions to the UI buttons which add to and remove from the lists. Added 
functionality to WeaponManager script which takes a reference to the struct of the currently equipped gun
and updates the graphics, UI and weapon characteristics. 

18/3/2020
Made progress on UI code, clicking on guns in inventory, equips them in game and removes the listing
from the inventory until another gun replaces it. Issues with list returning empty, fixed upon 
discovering that I had a duplicate of the script on another game object it shouldn't have been on. 
Created gun model for M4A1 and scope object which contains a camera that renders to the 3d object.

19/2/2020
Finished UI code, equipping a gun displays its name and image next to the list of guns in the inventory.
Created new wall asset (red stripe), and created right corridor, staircase and staff room sections of 
the map. 

20/3/2020
Added health bar graphic to UI with bar which shrinks in size when the player takes damage. Added function
to zombie so that on collision with player, they take damage. Added a delay of a couple seconds between
the player getting hit and being able to take damage again.
Created graphics to display round number and the amount of money the player has and linked them to the 
player_stats script.

23/3/2020
Created door asset and optimised for unity. Created function for player which casts a ray out in front,
and if it hits a door it will display a prompt to press 'E' and a cost. While the cost is on screen, if 
they have the required funds, pressing E will subtract the cost from the players total money, and open
the door, syncing the animation across all clients, and updating the zombies' navmesh path. 

24/3/2020
Identified issue with zombies not being able to leave their spawn areas. Solved by adding the the wall
that the zombies can pass through but the player cannot, into a new layer, and setting the navmesh to
ignore that layer when baking. This sets up the zombies path correctly and allows them to spawn.

Identified issue with FMP proposal which could result in having to think of a new idea due to being unable
to safely test my previous idea because of Covid-19.

Implemented Unity high-definition rendering pipeline and post processing effects such as anti-aliasing and 
improved shadows & light maps. Issue with all materials displaying as bright pink. After troubleshooting
discovered that lighting mode must be set to Linear as Gamma is not supported at the time of writing.

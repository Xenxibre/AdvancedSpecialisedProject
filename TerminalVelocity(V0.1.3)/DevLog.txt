20/1/2020 - Work (16:00 - 00:30)
Began development of networking, had to begin project again in new version of unity as
the version I was using did not have support for Photon PUN, my plugin of choice. Established connection 
from game to Photon servers.

22/1/2020
Created 'battle button' style matchmaking with one-click connect functionality. Learnt the basics of how to
use the photon plugin so I can develop my own matchmaking system as one-click is not great for the game I 
want to make. 

24/1/2020
Implemented 'server browser' style matchmaking with room creation and host migration. Player types in their 
chosen username before connecting to the photon master servers and seeing an available list of rooms which 
can be joined and the option to create a room of their own. Player that creates the room has a start button
available to them which can be clicked whenever all players are ready.

Fixed issue with matchmaking UI that was causing all elements 
to spawn on top of each other. Fixed issues with spawning players into rooms.

Moved weapon input and control to the networked player object so the weapons position and animations
can later be synced across the network. Designed new weapon equipping system with weapon manager parent object 
that holds a list of all weapons and a function to return one at a passed in index. This is then managed by the 
networked player object which gets the one it needs and all of the relevant info.
